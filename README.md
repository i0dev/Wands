# Wands Plugin!

This plugin allows you to get lightning wands that you can summon lightning to charge creepers, or just to smite your
friends!

This is a PLUGIN, and it goes into your `/plugins/` folder on your server. It will not work if It's elsewhere!

You can receive one of these wands with it given to you with `/wand give <player> <tier> [amount]`, and just right-click
the ground for it to strike a lightning bolt at that location
